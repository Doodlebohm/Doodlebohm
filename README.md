# About Me

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a cozy puzzle game called Panda Push, a demo is available on Itch.io at https://doodlebohm.itch.io/panda-push 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning coding through the cs50 course online and Unity through YouTube tutorials.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate in Game Jams, I would be most helpful as a pixel artist at this point but hope to expand to more roles as my skills increase.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Uncharted. Any time.
